BUGS

bug 1: The Obstacle speed was not updated as fast the ground speed.

bug 1: This is a weird bug because it if i reduce the score/100 thing even by 0.1 then at some point of time the obstacles start going faster than the ground. (not solved)

bug 2: The t-rex's collider was very big and the obstacles one was ok so I used the " setCollider " command and used circle collider. (solved)

bug 3: This, I think needs a very fast CPU. (not solved)
